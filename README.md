# exercises

This repository is a collection of various algorithms implemented for learning purposes.

* ```ratelimiters```: Contains concurrent-safe implementations of Token Bucket, Leaky Bucket, Fixed Window, and Sliding Window algorithms in Go (Golang).
  
* ```chatclientserver```: Includes implementations of a chat server and chat client using Go concurrency.

* ```seamcarving```: Implementation of the [Seam Carving](https://andrewdcampbell.github.io/seam-carving) algorithm in Kotlin.

* ```filetypeanalyzer```: A project from [Hyperskill](https://hyperskill.org/projects/357) aimed at identifying the type of a given file by analyzing its first few bytes and searching for known patterns. Three algorithms are implemented for solving this task: Brute-Force, Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP), and Rabin-Karp.

* ```code_analyser.py```: A project from [Hyperskill](https://hyperskill.org/projects/112). A simple static analyzer tool written in Python. It identifies common stylistic issues in Python code using the ```ast``` module, designed to provide a general understanding of static code analysis and expand Python competency.

* ```binomialpq.py```: contains implementation of [binomial priority queue](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs106x/res/handouts/25-Assignment-5-PQueue.pdf).

* ```minpq.py```: contains implementation of minimum priority queue in python.

* ```boggle.py```: contains implementation of [boggle game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boggle).

* ```trie.py```: contains implementation of the Trie data structure.

* ```sudokusolver.py```: solver for the Sudoku puzzles.

* ```knightstour.py```: contains implementation of [knight's tour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight's_tour).

* ```nqueens.py```: contains implementation of n queens problem.
