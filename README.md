# exercises

This repo contains various algorithms implemented for learning purpose

* ```binomialpq.py```: contains implementation of [binomial priority queue](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs106x/res/handouts/25-Assignment-5-PQueue.pdf).
* ```minpq.py```: contains implementation of minimum priority queue in python.
* ```boggle.py```: contains implementation of [boggle game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boggle).
* ```trie.py```: contains implementation of the Trie data structure.
* ```code_analyser.py```: Simple static analyzer tool that finds common stylistic issues in Python code using the ```ast``` module, with the motivation to get a general idea of static code analysis and expand my competence in Python.
* ```knightstour.py```: contains implementation of [knight's tour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight's_tour).
* ```nqueens.py```: contains implementation of n queens problem.
* ```sudokusolver.py```: solver for the Sudoku puzzles.
* ```filetypeanalyzer```: This is a project from Jetbrains Academy. The task is to find the type of a given file, it does so by analyzing first few bytes of a given file searching for the known patterns Three algorithms are implemented for solving this, they are Brute-Force, Knuth-Morris-Pratt(KMP) and Rabin-Karp.
* ```seamcarving```: Implementation of the [Seam Carving](https://andrewdcampbell.github.io/seam-carving) algorithm in Kotlin.
* ```chatclientserver```: Contains implementations of chat server and chat client using Go concurrency.
